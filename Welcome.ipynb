    "\n",
    "The Iguazio Data Science Platform (**\"the platform\"**) is a fully integrated and secure data science platform as a service (PaaS), which simplifies development, accelerates performance, facilitates collaboration, and addresses operational challenges.\n",
    "The platform incorporates the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A data science workbench that includes Jupyter Notebook, integrated analytics engines, and Python packages\n",
    "- Real-time dashboards based on Grafana\n",
    "- Managed data and machine-learning (ML) services over a scalable Kubernetes cluster\n",
    "- A real-time serverless functions framework &mdash; Nuclio\n",
    "- An extremely fast and secure data layer that supports SQL, NoSQL, time-series databases, files (simple objects), and streaming\n",
    "- Integration with third-party data sources such as Amazon S3, HDFS, SQL databases, and streaming or messaging protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><img src=\"assets/images/igz-self-service-platform.png\" alt=\"Self-service data science platform\" width=\"650\"/><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform uses [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) (k8s) as the baseline cluster manager, and deploys various application microservices on top of Kubernetes to address different data science tasks.\n",
    "Most of the provided services support scaling out and GPU acceleration and have a secure and low-latency access to the platform's shared data store and file system, enabling high performance and scalability with maximum resource efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform makes extensive use of [Nuclio serverless functions](https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio) to automate various tasks &mdash; such as data collection, extract-transform-load (ETL) processes, model serving, and batch jobs.\n",
    "Nuclio functions describe the code and include all the required resource definitions and configuration for running the code.\n",
    "The functions auto scale and can be versioned.\n",
    "The platform supports various methods for generating Nuclio functions &mdash; using the graphical dashboard, Docker, Git, or Jupyter Notebook &mdash; as demonstrated in the platform tutorials.\n",

    "- [Dask](https://dask.org/) parallel-computing Python library, including scaled pandas DataFrames\n",
    "- [V3IO Frames](https://github.com/v3io/frames) <font color=\"#00BCF2\">\\[Tech Preview\\]</font> &mdash; Iguazio's open-source data-access library, which provides a unified high-performance API for accessing NoSQL, stream, and time-series data in the platform's data store and features native integration with pandas and [NVIDIA RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/)\n",
    "- Built-in support for ML packages such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [Pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "All these tools are integrated with the platform's Jupyter Notebook service, allowing users to access the same data from Jupyter through different interfaces with minimal configuration overhead.\n",
    "Users can easily install additional Python packages by using the [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) binary package and environment manager and the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) Python package installer, which are both available as part of the Jupyter Notebook service.\n",
    "This design, coupled with the platform's unified data model, enables users to store and access data using different formats &mdash; such as NoSQL (\"key/value\"), time series, stream data, and files (simple objects) &mdash; and leverage different tools and APIs for accessing and manipulating the data, all from a single development environment (namely, Jupyter Notebook).\n",

    "The platform allows you to easily deploy your models to production in a reproducible way by using the open-source Nuclio serverless framework.\n",
    "You provide Nuclio with code or Jupyter notebooks, resource definitions (such as CPU, memory, and GPU), environment variables, package or software dependencies, data links, and trigger information.\n",
    "Nuclio uses this information to automatically build the code, generate custom container images, and connect them to the relevant compute or data resources.\n",
    "The functions can be triggered by a wide variety of event sources, including the most commonly used streaming and messaging protocols, HTTP APIs, scheduled (cron) tasks, and batch jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nuclio functions can be created from the platform dashboard or by using standard code IDEs, and can be deployed on your platform cluster.\n",
    "A convenient way to develop and deploy Nuclio functions is by using Jupyter Notebook and Python tools.\n",

    "For example, you can plot or chart data within Jupyter Notebook using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/); use your favorite BI visualization tools, such as [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com), to query data in the platform over a Java database connectivity connector (JDBC); or build real-time dashboards in Grafana.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data analytics and visualization tools and services generate telemetry and log data that can be stored using the platform's time-series database (TSDB) service or by using external tools such as [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).\n",
    "Platform users can easily instrument code and functions to collect various statistics or logs, and explore the collected data in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana) open-source analytics and monitoring framework is natively integrated into the platform, allowing users to create dashboards that provide access to platform NoSQL tables and time-series databases from different dashboard widgets.\n",
